# Check for Dumps

If the extraction does not work and you end up with the session being terminated. For troubleshooting, go to transaction code `ST22` with the dialog user and check if there are any dumps with the Extraction user.

If there are dumps with Extraction User, contact technical support to resolve the issues.
