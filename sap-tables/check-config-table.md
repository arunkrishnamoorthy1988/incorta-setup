# Check Configuratin Table Entries

If the Schema Discovery does not work, check if the table entries `ZINC_CONFIG_PROP` is empty. If the table is empty it means the import was not performed correctly.

While importing the TR it is mandatory to give the `Target Client` to copy the Configuration entries to the table.

**Resolution**: Reimport the TR by selecting target client
